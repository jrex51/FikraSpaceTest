/*so as you can quickly tell that this is no working function and don't get me wrong I'm not making any
*excuses so I'm just gonna clarify something
*I fully understood the question and its requirements but I failed to implement them due to my lack of
*expeirience with writing code
*so I will explain how would I solve these problems IF I knew how to code them (hopefully you'd accept me and teach me :) )
*first to know who has the most oscars we have to compare the names to each other and figure out whose name came up the most
*thus printing his name
*second for knowing who's the oldest we just compare the age of every actor and actress and find the biggest age then pull
*the corresponding name and movie of that actor\actress
*the third problem requires comparing years and names, if a name is the same for consecutive years
* and is consecutive the most then we pull that name 
*if ONLY I knew how to convert these text inormation into data that I can use then all of this could easily be done with
*simple statements
*I sat down for hours trying everything I know (putting them in an array, in a list, in an arraylist but I couldnt make it work
